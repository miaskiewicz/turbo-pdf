//! The PDF emitter (§7, Stage 5): turns a paginated `[Page]` into the bytes of a
//! valid PDF 1.7. This is the spine's terminal stage — everything upstream
//! (template → cascade → layout → pagination) feeds a `Vec<Page>` in here.
//!
//! **Units.** The galley and page geometry are in CSS pixels at 96 dpi; PDF user
//! space is points (1/72 in). We scale every coordinate by `PX_TO_PT = 72/96`
//! ([`unit::px_to_pt`]). The galley is y-down with the origin at the page's top
//! left; PDF is y-up with the origin at the bottom left, so y is flipped against
//! the page height ([`unit::flip_y`]).
//!
//! **Determinism (AC-7.6).** Nothing here reads the clock or any entropy. Fonts
//! are collected in first-encounter order, the creation date falls back to a
//! fixed sentinel when the caller supplies none, and `pdf-writer` lays objects
//! out in a stable order — so identical inputs yield byte-identical output.
//!
//! The work is split across small modules: [`document`] (catalog + page tree),
//! [`page`] (per-page content stream), [`text`] (text-showing ops), [`graphics`]
//! (background/border rects), [`fonts`] (subsetting + embedding), [`color`]
//! (device RGB) and [`meta`] (the document info dict).
