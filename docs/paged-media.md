# Paged media: directives, headers/footers, footnotes, pagination

turbo-pdf paginates automatically: **page count is an output, never an input**.
You write a continuous body, declare optional running headers/footers and
footnotes with `t:` directives, set the page geometry with `@page`, and the
fragmenter fills one page at a time.

This document covers the `t:` directives, running headers/footers and the
per-page context, footnotes, and the pagination rules. See
[dsl.md](dsl.md) for templating and [css-support.md](css-support.md) for CSS.

## 1. The `t:` directives

`t:`-prefixed elements are recognized as typed directives
(`crates/turbo-pdf-core/src/node.rs`, `TKind`). The parser knows the following
local names. Their implementation status (verified against the handling code and
`TODO(phase…)` markers) is:

| Directive | Status | What it does |
|---|---|---|
| `<t:running-header>` | **Implemented** | Declares the per-page running header region (§3.0). See [below](#running-headers-and-footers). |
| `<t:running-footer>` | **Implemented** | Declares the per-page running footer region. |
| `<t:page/>` | **Implemented** (inside a region) | The current 1-based page number. Desugars to `{{ page.number }}`. |
| `<t:pages/>` | **Implemented** (inside a region) | The total page count. Desugars to `{{ page.total }}`. |
| `<t:footnote>` | **Implemented** | An inline footnote marker whose body flows to the footnote area of the page the marker lands on (§3.6). |
| `<t:footnote-separator>` | Recognized; a default separator rule is always drawn | The element kind is parsed, but the footnote band currently paints a built-in default separator rule (a thin black box). A custom separator from this element is **not yet wired in**. |
| `<t:page-master>` | **Deferred** — `TODO(phase7b)` | Page master definition. Parsed but not implemented. |
| `<t:variant>` | **Deferred** — `TODO(phase7b)` | Page-master variant. Parsed but not implemented. |
| `<t:use-master>` | **Deferred** — `TODO(phase7b)` | Apply a named page master. Parsed but not implemented. |
| `<t:region>` | **Deferred** — `TODO(phase7b)` | Named master region. Parsed but not implemented. |
| `<t:counter>` | **Deferred** — `TODO(phase7b)` | General named counter. Parsed but not implemented. |
| `<t:leader>` | **Deferred** — `TODO(phase7b)` | Dot-leader fill (e.g. for a TOC). Parsed but not implemented. |
| `<t:anchor>` | **Deferred** — `TODO(phase15)` | Section anchor (needed for `section`-reset footnotes). Parsed but not implemented. |
| `<t:endnote>` | **Deferred** — `TODO(phase15)` | Document-end note. Parsed but not implemented. |
| `<t:endnotes>` | **Deferred** — `TODO(phase15)` | Endnote collection point. Parsed but not implemented. |

The two field codes `<t:page/>` and `<t:pages/>` are only meaningful **inside a
running region**, where they desugar to `{{ page.number }}` / `{{ page.total }}`
(see `template/regions.rs`). Both the self-closing form (`<t:page/>`) and the
explicit pair (`<t:page></t:page>`) are accepted.

---

## 2. Running headers and footers

Place a `<t:running-header>` and/or `<t:running-footer>` **anywhere** in the
template. Their inner markup is lifted out of the body flow at compile time and
re-rendered once per page, so they never appear in the body. Source of truth:
`template/regions.rs` + `render.rs`.

```html
<t:running-footer>Page <t:page/> of <t:pages/></t:running-footer>
<p>… body …</p>
```

The footer above is the ergonomic "Page X of N": `<t:page/>` and `<t:pages/>`
desugar to the page-context variables, so no expression syntax is needed.

### The per-page context

Each region is rendered against a context with two top-level keys:

- `page` — the per-page state, with fields:
  - `page.number` — 1-based page number (also `<t:page/>`).
  - `page.total` — total page count (also `<t:pages/>`).
  - `page.is_first` — true on the first page.
  - `page.is_last` — true on the last page.
- `data` — the caller's original document data, so a region can interpolate both
  page state and document fields.

```html
<!-- print only on the last page -->
<t:running-footer>{% if page.is_last %}END{% endif %}</t:running-footer>

<!-- combine document data and page number -->
<t:running-footer>{{ data.doc }} p<t:page/></t:running-footer>
```

(Verified in `tests/render.rs`: the page number is late-evaluated per page, and
`page.is_last` / `data.*` work inside the footer.)

### Sizing and overflow

A region's height is measured once and reserved as a band at the top (header) or
bottom (footer) of the page, **capped at the page margin** so a region can never
push into the body or past the page edge. If a region's content is taller than
its reserved band, the overflowing lines are **clipped** and a `RegionOverflow`
lint is emitted (the body is never overlapped).

> One-pass approximation (documented in `render.rs`): the band height is measured
> using a representative page-1 context (`number = 1`, `total = 1`). A region
> whose *height* changes with the page number reserves the page-1 height on every
> page; per-page content taller than that band is clipped + linted. A full
> fixpoint over band height is `TODO(phase7b)`.

---

## 3. Footnotes

A `<t:footnote>` leaves a numbered marker inline and moves its body to the
footnote area of whatever page the marker lands on **after pagination**. Source:
`paginate/footnotes.rs` + `render.rs`; behavior verified in `tests/footnotes.rs`.

```html
<p>Cited<t:footnote>the note body</t:footnote> here.</p>
```

### Auto-numbering

Auto notes take the next integer in document order (`1`, `2`, `3`, …). The
default numbering is **document-continuous** across all pages.

### Manual marks

A `mark` attribute supplies an explicit marker that overrides auto-numbering, and
runs an **independent** sequence from the auto notes:

```html
<p>Body<t:footnote mark="*">starred note</t:footnote>.</p>
```

### Reset modes (`footnote-reset`)

The `footnote-reset` attribute controls how auto-numbering resets. The **first**
`footnote-reset` declared on any footnote sets the document policy.

- `footnote-reset="page"` — restart auto-numbering at 1 on each page. (After
  pagination, the notes that landed on a page are renumbered from their position
  on that page; manual marks still pass through unchanged.)
- absent, `none`, or `section` — **continuous** numbering. (`section` reset
  awaits section anchors and is currently treated as continuous —
  `TODO(phase15)`.)

```html
<t:footnote footnote-reset="page">policy note</t:footnote>
```

### The footnote band and separator

The footnote area sits above the bottom margin (and the footer band, if any) and
grows upward as notes accumulate. A **separator rule** — a thin full-width black
box — heads the band on every page that has notes. (A custom
`<t:footnote-separator>` element is parsed but not yet wired in; the default rule
is always used.)

### Oversized-note continuation

A footnote taller than the whole footnote area **continues onto the next page's
footnote area**, split line by line, so content is never dropped (§3.18).

### Convergence

Footnotes are a mutual constraint: a page's notes reserve area at its bottom,
which shrinks its body capacity, which can change which markers land on it. This
is resolved by a damped fixpoint (cap of 4 passes). In the common case it
converges silently. If it does not converge within the cap, the last placement is
accepted and a `FootnoteConvergence` lint is emitted — content is never dropped.

---

## 4. Pagination

The break walk (`paginate/walk.rs`) fills one page's body capacity at a time and
starts a fresh page when the current one fills. Page count is purely a function
of content and capacity.

### Page geometry — `@page`

Set the page size and margin with an `@page` at-rule in your CSS
(`paginate/geometry.rs`). The internal unit is CSS pixels at 96 dpi.

```css
@page { size: A4; margin: 20mm }
@page { size: Letter }
@page { size: A4 landscape }
@page { size: 400px 500px; margin: 10px 20px }
@page { size: 300px }            /* a single length is a square */
```

**`size`** accepts:

- A **named size**: `A3`, `A4`, `A5`, `Letter`, `Legal` (case-insensitive).
- **One length** `W` — a square `W × W`.
- **Two lengths** `W H`.
- An optional `portrait` / `landscape` keyword, which may accompany a named size
  (`A4 landscape` swaps width and height). With no dimensions and only
  `landscape`, the default A4 is used and oriented landscape.

An **unknown** named size is a fatal render error.

**`margin`** accepts the standard 1 / 2 / 4 length shorthand:

- `margin: 20mm` — all four sides.
- `margin: 10px 20px` — vertical / horizontal.
- `margin: 1px 2px 3px 4px` — top / right / bottom / left.

**Default geometry** (when there is no `@page`, or `@page` sets only one of
size/margin): **A4 portrait with uniform 20 mm margins.**

> Named *pseudo-pages* (e.g. `@page :first`) and per-page masters are not
> implemented in this slice — `TODO(phase7b)`. The first `@page` at-rule's
> `size`/`margin` declarations are what take effect.

### Break rules

Break behavior is driven by CSS on the body content (see
[css-support.md](css-support.md#break-control)). The decision precedence is
(highest first):

1. **Forced break** — `break-before: page` / `break-after: page` (the value
   `column` is treated as `page`).
2. **Atomicity** — `break-inside: avoid` keeps a block together where it fits.
3. **Widows / orphans** (paragraphs).
4. **Greedy fill** — otherwise the block goes where it fits, splitting if it
   cannot fit on any page.

A block that cannot fit even on an empty page is split internally; an atomic leaf
taller than a page overflows onto a fresh page with a `RegionOverflow` lint
(content is never dropped).

### Orphans and widows

Paragraphs honor `orphans` (minimum lines before a break) and `widows` (minimum
lines after a break), default `2` each.

- **Widows** pull lines back from a break so at least `widows` lines start the
  next page.
- **Orphans**: if fewer than `orphans` lines would remain on the current page,
  the whole run is deferred to the next page.
- On an otherwise-empty page where orphans cannot be satisfied, whatever fits is
  placed anyway (no infinite deferral).

### Repeatable table headers

`<thead>` rows (UA `display: table-header-group`) and `<tfoot>` rows
(`table-footer-group`) are marked repeatable, so when a table spans multiple
pages the header is **re-emitted atop every continued page** (`layout/table.rs`,
`paginate/walk.rs`). This needs no extra attribute — just use `<thead>`:

```html
<table>
  <thead><tr><th>Item</th><th>Amount</th></tr></thead>
  <tbody>
    <tr><td>…</td><td>…</td></tr>
    <!-- many rows … -->
  </tbody>
</table>
```

### Documented pagination limitations

From `paginate/walk.rs`:

- When a block is split across pages, its box wrapper (background/border) is **not
  re-emitted** around each part — children are emitted directly.
- Orphans/widows are enforced at each single break, but a paragraph tail spanning
  more than two pages is greedy.

Both are refined alongside the emitter in a later phase.
